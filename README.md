## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice making responsive layouts with a mobile-first workflow.

I learned about **semantics** and **accessibility**, like making sure to use the right tags based on functionality (e.g. `button` for *actions* and `a` for *navigating* to a different page) and adding landmarks for accessibility.

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning about accessibility, especially ARIA attributes and how I can use them to make my pages accessible. I also think there's room for improvement on how I write CSS, so I plan to look into resources on this.

### Useful resources

- [Cards](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/) - A great article that helped me gain a better understanding of how to structure an inclusive card component. I really like how the author talks about his thought process, considering how the markup would appear to screen readers and keyboard users.

- [CSS Inheritance, The Cascade And Global Scope: Your New Old Worst Best Friends](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/css-inheritance-cascade-global-scope-new-old-worst-best-friends/) - This article talks about CSS inheritance and the cascade and how to leverage them when writing CSS. I still haven't developed a "style" of writing CSS, but I prefer this approach over more popular CSS frameworks.
